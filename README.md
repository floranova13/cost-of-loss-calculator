# Cost of Loss Calculator

## Open Avenues Foundation:
"Open Avenues Foundation launches programs that create upward mobility for people and communities in the United States. "

## Project Details:
Companies need talent but are wary of the visa and immigration process. Using an excel spreadsheet provided by OAF, we created an application in React to store lead generation information (user name, contact, etc) and provide a "cost demo" that calculates and shows the cost of losing a foreign-born employee.

### REST API
The REST API back-end uses MySQL and Sequelize.

### React Front-end
The React front-end shows allows to access the cost demo. And uses the Axios package to post user information when a PDF is printed.
